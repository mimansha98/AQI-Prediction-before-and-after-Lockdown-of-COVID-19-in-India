# AQI-Prediction-before-and-after-Lockdown-of-COVID-19-in-India

1. The study analyses the AQI and predicts before and after lockdown of COVID-19 in India. The values for the future is also predicted using the SARIMA model and LSTM algorithm.  

2. SARIMA stands for Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model is capable of analysing and representing stationary and non-stationary time series by using optimal hyperparameters for better prediction.  

3. The performance evaluation of the forecasting models by calculating mean square error, mean absolute error, and root mean square error (RMSE) which may help control the degraded air quality.
